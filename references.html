The thrust levers will be reduced slowly and smoothly to achieve VREF by 50’ AGL.  
        The PF will initiate the flare between 30’ and 20’ AGL (CRJ-900) or initiate the pre-flare between 30’ and 20’ AGL and a full flare at 10’ AGL (CRJ-200).  Rudder will be applied smoothly to align the aircraft with the runway centerline with aileron used to prevent a sideways drift.  
        The PM will monitor the aircraft state and flight path parameters and will promptly announce any deviations.  The PF will maintain back pressure on the control column as necessary to hold a constant pitch angle and will transition sight from the touchdown zone to the runway end.  
        The aircraft will touch down at VREF or less within the touchdown zone and the PF will verify the thrust levers are at idle.  The PM will call “spoilers green” when the spoiler advisory message is displayed.  The PF will select thrust reversers to idle while lowering the nosewheel to the runway and will increase reverse thrust as needed after nosewheel touchdown.  
        The PM will verify normal reverse thrust operation.  The PF will apply the brakes by steadily increasing pedal pressure, adjusting for runway conditions and length.  The PM will call “90 knots” and the PF will initiate movement of the thrust reversers toward idle.  The PF will ensure the thrust reversers reach the idle detent by 60 knots.  
        The PF will maintain aileron into the wind until exiting the runway.  Control of the aircraft will be transferred, if required.  The captain will transition to nosewheel steering via the tiller and will exit the runway without delay at the first available taxiway, or as instructed by ATC.</td>

      <td>The aircraft will touch down at VREF or less within the touchdown zone and the PF will immediately select idle reverse thrust upon main wheel touchdown.  The PF will ensure a positive touchdown for initial wheel spin up and breakout of frozen brakes if icing has occurred.  
        The nosewheel will be lowered immediately.  
        The PF will apply maximum reverse thrust as soon as possible after nosewheel touchdown.  The PM will call “spoilers green” when the spoiler advisory message is displayed.  The PF will anticipate skidding and/or hydroplaning and will make necessary corrections.  
        If a loss of directional control occurs, the PF will reduce reverse thrust to idle and if necessary, will return to forward idle thrust.  Brakes will be applied normally with steadily increasing pressure, allowing the anti-skid system to modulate brake pressure.</td>
